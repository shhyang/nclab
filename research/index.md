## Research

The research of NCLab will focus on: 
1.	Network coding technologies for wireless networking
2.	Distributed storage, caching, and computing systems
3.	Network information sciences
4.	Information theoretic fundations for machine learning and big data

In the first three years, the goal of NCLab includes:
i)	Build at least three network coding systems for distribution storage, IoT, robotic systems and so on; 
ii)	Publish more than 30 research papers and apply for more than 10 patents; 
iii)	Train more than 20 students and researchers; 
iv)	Transfer at least one network coding technology; and 
v)	Apply for more than 10 research grants from Shenzhen, Guangdong and National funding sources.
In the long term, we wish to build a network information science research institute based on NCLab.
