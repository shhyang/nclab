(ref to netcod papers for the following topics)

- ~~Benefits of Opportunistic Routing, Implicit Acknowledgments, and Network Coding on a Linear Broadcast Network, NetCod'17 (Jun)~~
- The Benefit of Limited Feedback to Generation-Based Random Linear Network Coding in Wireless Broadcast, NetCod'17 (Jun)
- Oblivious transmission, and "The Capacity of Symmetric Private Information Retrieval" at NetCod'17
- Implementations of network coding
  - eSPOC: enhanced Secure Practical Network Coding for Better Efficiency and Lower Latency, NetCod'17
  - www.chocolate-clould.cc, where RLNC is used to provide the reliability, which means BATS/chunked codes may be used for the similar applications.
  - https://cn.ifn.et.tu-dresden.de/research/areas/, check out the recent works about network coding implementations in europe. 
  - Network Coding to Provide Reliable Communications in Powerline. This was not presented at NetCod'17, but we may check out their works.
- Network function computation, graph entropy and coded distrubuted computing. 
  - ~~On Computation Rates for Arithmetic Sum, Arxiv.~~
  - Sum-networks from incidence structures: construction and capacity analysis, Arxiv.

- Joint FEC across Multiple Streams with Different Playout Deadlines, NetCod'17.  This may be related to the work of Cheuk Ting Li.
