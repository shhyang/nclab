## Resource Request

To support the initial research of NCLab, we would request a temporary office/lab space for about 60 square meters. From 2017 to 2018, we plan to further hire
+ 2 Associate Research Fellows and/or Senior Engineers
+ 2 part-time Research Fellows
+ 2~4 Research Assistants anld Engineers 
		
The ballpark budget for the first 1.5 years is estimated to be around RMB 2.5 million, for the research staff, office/facilities setup, and miscellaneous costs, where only 1.5 million can be supported using the existing funding of the team from Shenzhen KCW and NSFC.

As a summary, we have the following space and funding request from CUHK(SZ):
+ Space: 60 square meters temporary office/lab space for 2017, and we project an office space need of 700 square meters for some 40 staff growing gradually in the years 2018 to 2021.
+ Funding: one million for hiring research staff in 2017 and 2018.
